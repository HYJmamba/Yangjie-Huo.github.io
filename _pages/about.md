I am a third-year master’s student at Hunan University of Technology and Business, with a bachelor’s degree from the School of Computer Science at Northwestern Polytechnical University. My research interests include small-sample learning and meta-learning. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Academician Chen Xiaohong, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of Xiangjiang Laboratory.
